# Profile App

## Overview

Profile App is a basic Flutter application that displays a user profile with editable fields and a list of user posts. This application includes features like state management, UI development, networking, image upload, and local storage using shared preferences. 

## Features

- **View and Edit Profile:** Users can view their profile information and edit details such as name, email, phone number, and address.
- **Profile Picture:** Users can select and display a profile picture from their device gallery.
- **View User Posts:** Users can navigate to a separate screen to view a list of posts.
- **Local Storage:** User profile data are stored locally using SharedPreferences for persistence.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure Flutter is installed on your local machine. You can download it from [Flutter's official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- **Dart SDK**: Dart SDK should be included with the Flutter installation.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/profile_app.git
   cd profile_app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**

   To run the application on an emulator or connected device, execute:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Project Structure

- **`lib/`**: Contains the main codebase.
  - **`main.dart`**: The entry point of the application.
  - **`user_post_page.dart`**: Screen to display the list of user posts.
- **`assets/`**: Contains image assets.
  - **`images/`**: Stores the profile picture and other images used in the app.
- **`pubspec.yaml`**: Manages the project's dependencies and assets.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following Flutter packages:

- **`flutter:`** The core framework for building the application.
- **`cupertino_icons:`** Provides the Cupertino icons used in iOS-style applications.
- **`http:`** For handling HTTP requests and networking.
- **`image_picker:`** Allows users to pick images from the gallery or capture new ones with the camera.
- **`image_pickers:`** Provides additional options for image picking.
- **`shared_preferences:`** Used for persisting simple data in the form of key-value pairs locally on the device.

Ensure these dependencies are included in your `pubspec.yaml` file and run `flutter pub get` to install them.
